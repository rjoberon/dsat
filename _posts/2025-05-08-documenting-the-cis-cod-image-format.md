After having acquired an almost complete understanding of the file
format of D-Sat 1, two important steps remain to make the satellite
images accessible: 1) understanding how to geo-reference the tiles and
2) understanding how to process the tiles, that is, open and transform
them. The second step requires an understanding of the CIS/COD raster
image file format – an endeavour where we have made quite some
progress during the last year. To document our findings we have set up
a [dedicated web page for documenting the CIS/COD image
format](https://cod.igada.de/) that is online since yesterday.
