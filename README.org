- there is a [[https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1998040842A1][patent describing the approach]]

- There existed [[ftp://ftp.sunet.se/mirror/archive/ftp.sunet.se/pub/pc/windows/winsock-indstate/Windows95/WWW-Browsers/Plug-In/][a browser plugin to decode such images]].
  - There also existed a [[https://web.archive.org/web/19970613234343/http://www.infinop.com/nhtml/java/index.shtml][Java browser applet]] whose classes were
    available (after [[https://web.archive.org/web/19970613235015/http://www.infinop.com/nhtml/download.shtml][filling out a form]]), both directly usable
    (e.g., [[https://web.archive.org/web/19970613234343/http://www.infinop.com/nhtml/java/Lightning.class][Lightning.class]], not archived) and as archive from a
    [[compressed][download page]] (classes.tgz).
- there seem to be [[https://web.archive.org/web/19970613235015/http://www.infinop.com/nhtml/javafaq.shtml][different (incompatible) versions]]:

  /I have tried to use some .cod images from my website inside the
  Java applet, and they do not display correctly. What could be
  wrong?/

  Most likely, they were compressed with an earlier version of
  Lightning Strike. The Java applet was designed for use with
  Lightning Strike 2.6 images, and for the sake of size and download
  time, was not made backward compatible. Try opening the images in
  the Lightning Strike 2.6 compressor and then resaving them in the
  new format.

** Coordinate format
- an older [[https://groups.google.com/g/de.org.ccc/c/xlaNafyxmrM/m/hXZj7J5ksc8J][usenet discussion on how to decode the geo coordinates]]
  - did we consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-42_reference_system][SK-42]] and derivatives?

* Next Steps

- [ ] Visualise the structure of dsatnord.mp, that is, where are city
  names and coordinates, where are the tiles, etc. Maybe that helps to
  find the index for the tiles.
- [ ] testing the Netscape plugin:
  - [ ] install it in a VM together with an older version of Firefox
  - [ ] test it with a [[http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Lightning_Strike][sample image]]
  - [ ] write one tile into a file and try to open it
- [ ] test [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-42_reference_system][SK-42]] and derivatives
