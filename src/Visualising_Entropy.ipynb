Since the tiles are stored sequentially in `dsatnord.mp`, the most simple way to identify them is their [byte offset](https://dsat.igada.de/2024/04/21/visualising-the-tile-size-distribution.html) within that file.

    "Then there are two options to search for them: either we transform the offsets into byte values or we transform the bytes of the target file into integers. I chose the second approach. In both cases we need to decide how to represent an integer, which basically requires us to settle the parameters of [`int.from_bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytes): number of bytes, byte order, and whether the value has a sign or not. Given the size of `dsatnord.mp`, two bytes (16 bit) are clearly not sufficient, so the next typical choice is 4 bytes (32 bit).

    "In such situations it helps to have someone else have a look and brainstorm what this could be. And as with [the magic number for the tiles](https://dsat.igada.de/2024/04/02/finding-the-tiles.html), my colleague Jan helped a lot to form the following hypothesis: *The repeated tiles fill the area outside Germany to form a rectangle.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This would mean that I could just continue plotting the tiles in a rectangular grid without any need to know the shape of Germany. That came somewhat as a surprise and showed some simplicity that I did not expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the next zoom level would be the remaining 2240 tiles of size 500x500. However, my first tries did not work and I got a garbled image. Having a look at one of our initial plots, we can see that at offset 3052 the offset 16194771 for the first 500x500 tile is repeated 30 times and then there is a gap (from bytes 3172 to 4012) filled with the \"outlier\" value 4278772525. So let us skip this first (repeated) tile and use only the tiles from byte 4016 to byte 15972. This makes 2989 = (15972 − 4016) / 4 (repeated) tiles which can be factored into 7 * 7 * 61. So one gues could be to use a grid of 49 columns and 61 rows: "

    "That looks familiar, doesn't it? The coast line of Germany is clearly visible. The vertical stripes outside of Germany are caused by the repetition of the \"border\" tiles, that is, the last tiles east and west that cover Germany. By not storing tiles that do not cover Germany, precious space could be saved on the CD-ROM. And by just repeating the border tiles, programming was simplified, since the shape of Germany was not required to load tiles – they tiles were just arranged in a rectangular grid. \n",

    "I hope you are as astonished as I was when I first saw that image. This definitely shows the north of Germany – the coastline and even the inland shape is clearly identifiable. Beyond this, there are more things to observe and explain:\n",
    "1. The horizontal bars east and west outside Germany are (again) caused by the repetition of the border tiles.\n",
    "2. We only see the northern half, since the southern half is stored on the second CD-ROM in the file `dsatsued.mp`. Almost we have not analysed that file so far, it is almost certain that it is structurally the same as `dsatnord.mp`.  \n",
    "3. Although the color of each pixel just indicates the byte size of the 1000x1000 pixel tile at that location, we can clearly see some structure. In particular, we can identify the Ruhr area in the west and several large cities, for example, Hamburg, Bremen, Hannover, Berlin, and Dresden. The reason for that is that the plot basically **visualises entropy**: images of the complex structure of streets and houses in cities have a higher entropy and thus can not be compressed as well as low-entropy images of fields, meadows and woods. How well data can be compressed is a measure of its entropy.\n",
    "4. Particularly in the middle of the image we can see \"traces\" of larger patches going from the bottom to the top in an angle of roughly 60° (measured from the bottom). My hypothesis is that these are caused by the orbit of the satellite who took the images. Depending on the weather (and other) conditions over a region during flyover, the quality of the images might be different, causing different entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So we now know how the tiles are arranged and that there's basically a(nother) \"pixel coordinate system\". What is missing is information on how to translate between those and well-known coordinate systems and projections. From a pessimistic point of view this means we are not much farther with our knowledge than from [the first post](https://dsat.igada.de/2005/03/26/decoding-the-city-database.html). However, today I would like to take the optimistic point of view and state that we have already reverse-engineered a very big part of the file format of D-Sat 1."
