# Information


## Coordinate format

-   an older [usenet discussion on how to decode the geo
    coordinates](https://groups.google.com/g/de.org.ccc/c/xlaNafyxmrM/m/hXZj7J5ksc8J)
    -   did we consider
        [SK-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-42_reference_system)
        and derivatives?

# Next Steps

-   [ ] Visualise the structure of dsatnord.mp, that is, where are city
    names and coordinates, where are the tiles, etc. Maybe that helps to
    find the index for the tiles.
-   [ ] testing the Netscape plugin:
    -   [ ] install it in a VM together with an older version of Firefox
    -   [ ] test it with a [sample
        image](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Lightning_Strike)
    -   [ ] write one tile into a file and try to open it
-   [ ] test
    [SK-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-42_reference_system) and
    derivatives
