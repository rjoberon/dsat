An approach to decode the file format that stores the information
(coordinates, satellite images) for DSatÂ 1.

## What is it about?

DSat was a series of CD/DVD-ROMs from the 1990s which contained aerial
and satellite imagery of Germany. The data was stored in a proprietary
file format and thus can only be used with the original Windows
programs. Since this is not sustainable, this project seeks to decode
the file format and develop tools to access the contained data.

[The first post on decoding the city
database](/2005/03/26/decoding-the-city-database.html) is a good
starting point for further reading.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Visualise the structure of `dsatnord.mp`, that is, where are city
  names and coordinates, where are the tiles, etc. Maybe that helps to
  find the index for the tiles.
- [ ] test
  [SK-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK-42_reference_system) and
  derivatives (check older [usenet discussion on how to decode the geo
  coordinates](https://groups.google.com/g/de.org.ccc/c/xlaNafyxmrM/m/hXZj7J5ksc8J))
