description: An endeavour to reverse-engineer the file format of D-Sat 1.
---

D-Sat was a series of CD/DVD-ROMs from the 1990s which contained
aerial and satellite imagery of Germany.[^1] At that time, this was a
milestone, since such imagery was not readily available (with
web-based services appearing only a couple of years later). The data
was stored in a proprietary file format and thus can only be used with
the original Windows programs. Since this is not sustainable, this
project seeks to reverse-engineer the file format of D-Sat 1 and
develop tools to access the contained data (coordinates, images,
etc.).

[The first post on decoding the city
database](/2005/03/26/decoding-the-city-database.html) is a good
starting point for further reading.
